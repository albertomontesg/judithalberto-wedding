intro: >
  In order to make everything as simple as possible, we recommend you different
  types of accomodation. All of them are close to the wedding place, and our
  wedding buses will also bring you / pick you up there (or very close).


  You will have to book your desired accommodation yourselves.
  However, we are happy to assist you in everything you may need.
