  In order to make everything as simple as possible, we have made sure that
  all of our guests can benefit from free accommodation at the bungalows of
  Camping La Siesta. However, if you would rather pay for your accommodation
  somewhere else, we suggest Hotel Arrels d'Empordà, which will offer you some
  discounts.

  The bungalows at [Camping La Siesta](http://www.campinglasiesta.com/en/), in Calella de Palafrugell, are a great choice due to their good location and nice facilities.


  The camping, at 5min from the beach, has a swimming pool, a fitness area,
  a supermarket, bars, and everything you may need.


  **Remember:**<br>

  Bungalows are similar to a hotel room. They all have their own
  kitchen and bathroom and, therefore, the bed sheets as well as the kitchen
  utensils are provided. You don't need to bring anything!

  The Aparthotel [Arrels d'Empordà****](https://www.arrelsemporda.com/en/), in Palafrugell, offers bedrooms and apartments for 1 to 5 people. The prices
  are really affordable, but to be able to profit from the discounts, you should
  mention our wedding and book your room by 26/06/2020.


  If you need specific information about the prices, please, contact us.


  **Remember:**<br>

  This accommodation is an alternative and, therefore, it will not be for free! The minimum stay required for this season is 2 nights.
