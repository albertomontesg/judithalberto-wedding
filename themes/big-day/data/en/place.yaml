  We're getting married at Mas Torroella, a 14th Century Catalan manor house which
  is provided by several gardens, an outdoor swimming pool, a tennis court, a
  spa and a sauna.


  **Everything we need to spend together an unforgettable weekend!**

  [Mas Torroella](http://www.mastorroella.com) is located at Cam√≠ de Fitor, between Palafrugell and Forallac.


  Since the way to the venue may be complicated, we have organised a few buses to facilitate the transportation of the guests. You can find more information at
  the section [Transport](#transport).
